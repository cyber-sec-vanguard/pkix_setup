# pkix_setup
## Description
A DevSecOps to establish a local root CA, and manage a local PKIX V2. To enable V3, you'll need to set some extensions and manage them yourself. You can always edit this code to support your extensions.

## Requirements
Only OpenSSL is required. The scripts will attempt to install it / update it.
## Features
  1. Create the local PKIX's needed folders and files, configure OpenSSL to use them.
  2. Create the CA's private RSA key, the CSR, and the certificate.
  3. Look for CSRs in the CSR folder, sign them, and publish them to the local certs folder.
  4. Verify certs.
  5. Print out certs

# How to use
Firstly, run `pkix_setup.sh`.
Secondly, run `cert_sign.sh`.
